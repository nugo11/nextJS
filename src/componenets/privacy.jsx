              reporting requirements, whichever is the longer. In particular, we

              data until you unsubscribe. To determine the appropriate retention
              period for your personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and

              process your personal data, applicable legal requirements or
              operational retention needs, and whether we can achieve those
              purposes through other means. Upon expiry of the applicable
              retention period we will securely destroy your personal data in
              accordance with applicable laws and regulations. In some
              circumstances we may anonymize your personal data so that it can
              no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer
              personal data. YOUR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS Certain

              personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any
              time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing of your
              data before we received notice that you wished to withdraw your
              consent. Right to lodge a complaint with the data protection
              authority: If you have a concern about our privacy practices,
              including the way we handled your personal data, you can report it
              to the UK data protection authority (the Information
              Commissioner’s Office or ICO), or, as the case may be, any other
              competent data protection authority of an EU member state that is
              authorized to hear those concerns (you may find EU Data Protection
              Authorities’ contact information here.) If you wish to exercise
              any of these rights please contact us as described in the
              “Contact” section below. We may also need to ask you for further
              information to verify your identity before we can respond to any
              request. DELETING PROFILE DETAILS If you would like to delete your
              Social Media Week account or profile, please send us an email from
              the email address that is associated with your Membership account
              to admin@filmebi.in. Please let us know your username in that
              email, so that we may complete your request accurately. You should
              be aware that it may not be technologically possible to remove
              each and every record of the information you have provided to us
              from our servers. The need to back-up our systems to protect
              information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your PII
              may exist in a non-erasable form that may be difficult or
              impossible for us to locate. In addition, we have the right to
              delete any account at any time if required to do so by process of
              law, or if necessary in order to investigate fraud, a violation of
              our Terms of Use or in connection with any harm being caused to a
              third party or their rights. CONTACT Questions, comments or
              requests regarding this Privacy Policy should be addressed to
              admin@filmebi.in. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY Any changes we may
              make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted on this
              page. Please check back frequently to see any updates or
              modifications. If required by the applicable law, we will notify
              you of any material or substantive changes to this Privacy Policy.
